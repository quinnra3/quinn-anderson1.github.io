## Welcome!

I am an epidemiology student, public health researcher, advocate for the outdoors, foster dog mom, and lifelong learner.

## Background

I am currently a student in the MSc in Epidemiology program at the Columbia Mailman School of Public Health. My previous research experience in the Lavender Lab at American University was related to studying sexual adolescent minority (SMA) behavioral health outcomes related to familial support. In 2018, I presented our findings at two conferences in Washington DC: the 52nd Association for Behavioral and Cognitive Therapies Convention and the Maryland Public Health Association Conference. 

When I'm not working behind a computer or in a lab, I can typically be found on a long run or hike, learning to climb, or fostering dogs transported to the Northeast from the south to rescue them from high kill shelters.

My professional work experience and resume can be found on this page [here](about.html).
